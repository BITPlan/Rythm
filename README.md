Rythm
=====

A "Razor" like, rich featured, high performance and easy to use Java template engine

Rythm is now 1 year old. It has been put into several real projects at least in China and Austrlia. 

For online demonstration please go to http://rythmengine.com/. If you are using Play!framework 1.2.x, then
you are lucky to have comprehensive document at http://www.playframework.com/modules/rythm, though most
of the content also applies to using rythm-engine in a pure Java environment.

For SpringMVC users, please checkout https://github.com/lawrence0819/spring-web-rythm-template.

I am now working hard to prepare it for R1.0 targeted April (hopefully not April first). The current
work load is on improving tests, documentation and sample applications.

Just stay tuned!
